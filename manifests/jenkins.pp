  # ----------- Install Jenkins Plugins -----------
  # The puppet-jenkins module has functionality for adding plugins but you must install the dependencies also(not done automatically). This was tried but
  # proved to be too much work. For example the delivery-pipeline-plugin has a total of 38 dependencies. 
  # It was decided to use the jenkins cli instead because it auto loads all the dependencies. 
  # We have to use the .jar manually because the name of the file was changed in jenkins itslef but the puppet plugin has not been updated yet,  https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-jenkins/pull/945

  #Installs the jenkins plugin delivery-pipeline-plugin. The cli will detect if the plugin is already present and do nothing if it is.
